== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use separate categories for the WordPress Media Library (and don't use the same categories as in posts & pages)? =
By default the WordPress Media Library uses the same categories as WordPress does (such as in posts & pages). If you want to use separate categories for the WordPress Media Library add this code to the file functions.php located in your theme or child-theme:
<code>
/**
* separate media categories from post categories
* use a custom category called 'category_media' for the categories in the media library
*/
add_filter( 'wpmediacategory_taxonomy', function(){ return 'category_media'; } ); //requires PHP 5.3 or newer
</code>


= How to use category in the [gallery] shortcode? =
To only show images from one category in the gallery you have to add the '`category`' attribute to the `[gallery]` shortcode.
The value passed to the '`category`' attribute can be either the `category slug` or the `term_id`, for example with the category slug:
<code>
[gallery category="my-category-slug"]
</code>
Or with term_id:
<code>
[gallery category="14"]
</code>
If you use an incorrect slug by default WordPress shows the images that are attached to the page / post that is displayed. If you use an incorrect term_id no images are shown.

Aside from this behavior, the `[gallery]` shortcode works as it does by default with the built-in shortcode from WordPress ([see the WordPress gallery shortcode codex page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode)). If you only want to show attachments uploaded to the page and filtered by category than use the '`id`' in combination with the '`category`' attribute. For example (the id of the post is 123):
<code>
[gallery category="my-category-slug" id="123"]
</code>
Or leave id empty for current page / post:
<code>
[gallery category="my-category-slug" id=""]
</code>
In this example the slug is used, but you could also use the term_id.
